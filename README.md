# Guitar-Pedals


## Tip-Ring-Sleeve (TRS) vs Tip-Sleeve (TS)

Guitar pedals usually use TS calbes for signal to connect from pedal to pedal or from guitar to pedal to the amp but TRS typically has a different use either used in conjunction with a separate foot pedal that controls a switch on the pedal or is used to send MIDI signal from on place to another

- TRS = balanced signal
- TS = unbalance signal
